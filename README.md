"# Playwright" 
This is the framework built for one sample banking application using **POM with playwright JAVA code**
These are the scenarios covered here--


**UI Test scenarios:**
Navigate to Para bank application.
Create a new user from user registration page (Ensure username is generated randomly and it is unique in every test execution).
Login to the application with the user created in step 2.
Verify if the Global navigation menu in home page is working as expected.
Create a Savings account from “Open New Account Page” and capture the account number.
Validate if Accounts overview page is displaying the balance details as expected.
Transfer funds from account created in step 5 to another account.
Pay the bill with account created in step 5.
Add necessary assertions at each test step whenever it is needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                **NOTE**  Due to time constraints, config.properties, and extent report are unable to implement constant properties, I can implement this playwright framework using JavaScript too.
